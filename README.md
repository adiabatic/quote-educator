# Quote Educator

I like having curly quotes in my Markdown files. The trouble is, Markdown files frequently have have quote marks in them that _shouldn’t_ be curled. Ever seen travesties like `print(“Hello, world!”)` in a blog post? A _good_ quote curler wouldn’t do that.

I make no claim that `quote-educator` is good, but it attempts to handle at least some of the edge cases that crop up in Markdown files.
